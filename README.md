# 🛴🕵🏻‍♂️ Scooter Sleuth v2 🛴🕵🏻‍♀️

We put a man on the moon but still need to switch between apps to find the closest electric scooter.  Not anymore!!
Scooter Sleuth aggregates scooter share apps into one map rendered based on the users location and available scooters.

To find scooters close to you, first enable location services in your browser.  The browsers coordinates are sent to each scooter company in the form of an API request. 

Use the logo buttons located at the top of the page to render and remove that companies This tells the  🛴🕵🏻‍♂️ Scooter Sleuth 🛴🕵🏻‍♀️  which companies too sleuth.
